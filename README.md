## üìÅ Contents

### üîπ AI-HW1: **Search Algorithms & Heuristic Optimization**
- **Notebook**: `AI_HW1_Practical.ipynb`
- **Overview**:  
  This assignment consists of two main parts:
  1. **Search Algorithms for Pathfinding**  
     Implements and compares performance of classical search algorithms including:
     - Uninformed: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)
     - Informed: Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A*  
     These are evaluated on both weighted and unweighted graphs to find the shortest path.
  2. **Subset Sum Optimization**  
     Explores heuristic search techniques to approximate the optimal subset of numbers summing closest to a target:
     - Brute Force Search  
     - Genetic Algorithms (GA)  
     - Hill Climbing  
     Comparison is made in terms of **accuracy** and **execution time**.

### üîπ AI-HW2: **CSPs, Cryptarithmetic, and Adversarial Search**
- **Notebook**: `AI-HW2-practical.ipynb`
- **Supporting Files**: `map.txt`, `input0.txt`
- **Overview**:  
  This multi-part assignment tackles a diverse set of AI problems:

  1. **Graph Coloring as a CSP ‚Äì The Kingdom Conflict of Eldoria**  
     Models a geopolitical conflict where rival kingdoms (nodes) must be assigned different ruling factions (colors) while minimizing the total number of factions.  
     Techniques:
     - Constraint Satisfaction Problem formulation  
     - Backtracking Search  
     - Heuristic variable ordering  

  2. **Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solving**  
     Decodes mathematical puzzles using CSP-based approaches to assign digits to letters under arithmetic constraints.

  3. **Adversarial Search in Othello**  
     Develops an AI agent for playing a simplified version of Othello using:
     - Minimax Algorithm  
     - Alpha-Beta Pruning  
     - Expectimax  
     The goal is to maximize win rate against heuristic or random opponents.

### üîπ AI-HW3: **Probabilistic Reasoning with HMMs and Bayesian Networks**
- **Notebook**: `AI_practical3.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `dna_dataset.csv`
- **Overview**:  
  Focuses on probabilistic models for sequence and structured data analysis:
  - Implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** on DNA sequences:
    - Forward Algorithm  
    - Viterbi Algorithm  
  - Constructs and reasons with a **Bayesian Network**:
    - Exact Inference via Enumeration and Variable Elimination  
    - Approximate Inference via Rejection Sampling and Likelihood Weighting  
  These methods are used to analyze and predict biological patterns from DNA data.

     Uses Decision Trees to predict buying behavior from features such as age and income.
  3. **Regression Models**  
     - Polynomial and Logistic Regression applied to numerical datasets.
     - XOR problem solved using:
       - Single-layer Perceptron (unsuccessful)
       - Multi-layer Perceptron (successful)
  4. **Image Filtering & Edge Detection**
